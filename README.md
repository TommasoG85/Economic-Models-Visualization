# Economic Models Visualization

This repository contains Python code for visualizing economic models, specifically focusing on the Von Neumann model, the Sraffa model, and PageRank analysis.

## Models Implemented:

1. **Von Neumann Model:**
    - Demonstrates the concept of a growth vector in the Von Neumann model.
    - Uses a 3D plot to visualize the sectors and their interdependencies.
    - Highlights the dominant eigenvector representing the direction of maximum growth.

2. **Sraffa Model:**
    - Visualizes the technical coefficients of the Sraffa model.
    - Uses a 3D plot to represent the sectors and their input-output relationships.
    - Shows the dominant eigenvector representing the proportions of technical coefficients.

3. **PageRank Analysis:**
    - Provides a basic example of PageRank calculation using the NetworkX library.
    - Visualizes a three-node graph with PageRank scores represented by node size and color.
    - Demonstrates the concept of node importance in a network.

## Libraries Used:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- mpl_toolkits (for 3D plotting)
- NetworkX

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install numpy matplotlib networkx`
3. Run the Python scripts in a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment.

## Notes:

- The code provides basic visualizations and can be extended for more complex scenarios.
- The PageRank example is a simple illustration and can be adapted for larger networks.
- The visualizations are interactive and allow for exploration of the models.
